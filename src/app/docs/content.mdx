  The rules here apply if you're using the hosted services (e.g. httptoolkit.com and app.httptoolkit.tech) and user accounts, or the published application binaries. This does not limit your open-source freedoms, and if you're building HTTP Toolkit yourself on your own infrastructure then only the open-source licenses apply.

  Note that the binaries specifically are dual-licensed: they're available under either the AGPL v3, guaranteeing open-source freedoms within the constraints of AGPL, or under the Creative Commons BY-ND license, allowing unencumbered licensing for simple unmodified use.
